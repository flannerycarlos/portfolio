      <p>Hi, I'm Flannery and I'm currently attending the part-time Full Stack Development Bootcamp through the University of Washington. This program allows me to take classes three days a week and still work my full-time job.</p>

      <p>In my regular work, I'm the Director of Content Operations at an tech company that does advertising analytics and conversion metrics to help brands understand the performance of their commercials, movie trailers and show promos on linear television and OTT platforms.</p>

      <p>Outside of work, obviously I am interesting in learning to code, but in my free time I also love going to the movies, playing board games, drinking with friends and hanging out with my family.</p>
